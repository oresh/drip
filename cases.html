              <span>How DripRevolution helped? The Outcome?</span>
              <p class="description">I tested this service on two sites. One site, the keyword pages were stuck on page 4 of google and had been for months. I threw 1000 social signals at them and at first, nothing happened. A few days went by, minor improvements. Then about a few weeks later I check and all pages are top 5 and holding.
              The second site...my page was holding a rather impressive #6 and had been for awhile. Threw 300 signals at it and now its #2. It also went from a Pagerank 3 to a 4.
              Great results. I honestly did not expect these things after 1 month subscription to this service.</p>

              <p class="description">I was looking for a good social signals service to provide 2 things to my websites. Social engagement and additional links from the social networks. Social is now becoming a part of Google's Algorithm and I wanted to of course rank my websites.</p>

              <span>Why did you chose DripRevolution?</span>
              <p class="description">I was playing around with Drip Revolution and Synnd. At the time Synnd did not provide all the same services and abilities that Drip Revolution provided. They both provided an automated approach, but Drip had a lot more flexibility and lower price point for me.

              <span>What do you like the most about DripRevolution?</span>
              <p class="description">I use Drip Revolution along with my other Link Building services on most sites I put out, it combines social bookmarking along with the power of social likes, shares, tweets etc. Drip Revolution has really provided a solution to get key social signals to your websites. Not only that, but you can also build these same indicators very easily to internal pages, YouTube videos, Web 2.0 and much more. This also helps create a link diversity into your link profile as well.</p>

            <div class="cases-qa">
              <span>How DripRevolution helped? The Outcome? </span>
              <p class="description">I am getting a steady drip of the main types of social sharing to my sites on a regular basis. I generally also add a second URL into the mix that is just for additional tweets and re-tweets to my money sites to promote them even further. I believe this has helped create an even further link diversity profile, provide Google some of what it is looking for in regards to social indicators and helped with my overall rankings...</p>

              <span>Any features you would like to see in DripRevolution?</span>
              <p class="description">One suggestion would be able to set a higher number over a longer period of time so like 60 days or 90 days so I don’t have to watch it as much. My company manages a lot of websites and it would be easier to say select 120 signals over 3 months.</p>

              <p class="description">When I launched my fashion blog, my Alexa ranking was probably around 13 million or something. I used some link building strategy on it and was able to bring it to a level that it used to get some visitors now and often with Alexa ranking of 600k million.
              About five months ago, I found DripRevolution through Google. Then my blog earned me $100 in a month. </p>

              <p class="description">Now comes the best part, I took the trial offer for the social signals and after it my Alexa ranking has moved to 400k. I know for some of you this may be a piece of cake, but this is an excellent jump with just trial offer so far. I'm using their small plan about 5 months and i finally achieved my long-term goal! I get approximately 250 unique visitors per day from different Social networks. Thanks to their social signals my blog now generates approximately $400/month.</p>

              Firstly, your service comes with a $1 7-day trial. I always like to try out trials because in this day and age, it's a good business practice to provide a trial if you know you have a quality product. It establishes trust.
              Secondly, the prices are very reasonable.
              Thirdly, because of ease of their dashboard and the ability to customize as many projects as you need is unparalleled from what else I've seen in the marketplace.</p>

              <span>For how long have you been using DripRevolution and how was this experience?</span>
              <p class="description">I've been using them for over 6 months so far and the experience has been terrific. I recommend them to anyone who's looking for social signals.</p>

              <span>What do you like the most about DripRevolution?</span>
              <p class="description">Total control over an unlimited amount of URLs, projects, messages, and signals. Most companies only offer you a few URLs to work with per each plan you have. That's ridiculous.</p>

              <span>How DripRevolution helped? The Outcome?</span>
              <p class="description">Every client who has requested an SEO plan from me has their site on the first page of google for several of their terms.</p>

            <div class="cases-qa">
              <span>Any features you would like to see in DripRevolution? (any improvements or changes?)</span>
              <p class="description">The ability to simply add fans and followers to pages for google +, twitter, and facebook fan pages, instead of treating them like social signals. Also, if we could have control to put activity and interaction on certain social media pages, this would save site owners more money because they wouldn't have to hire a third party to do it.</p>
