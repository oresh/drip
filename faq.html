When we are about to make a decision, we consult our friends and other experienced people to get good advice and recommendations from all parties and arrive to the best solution. Well, the concept of recommendations has come to search engines in the form of "Social Signal". All of your Likes, Tweets, Pins & Shares are considered by search engines as votes of trust. Social Signals, as a result, act like human recommendations for your website.</p>
